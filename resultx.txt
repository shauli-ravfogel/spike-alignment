arg1:[e]paracetamol is $not useful for treating arg2:[e]asthma.
0	However , while <s1>h:tocilizumab<e1> is a promising agent against COVID-19 , it is not an appropriate agent in <s2>h:patients with h:active or h:latent h:tuberculosis , h:bacterial and h:fungal h:infections , h:multi-organ h:failure , and h:gastrointestinal h:perforation<e2> [ 7 ] .
1	There are cases of ADEM or even fulminant presentation such as AHL where <s1>h:steroids alone<e1> are not sufficient for <s2>h:suppressing h:inflammation and h:improving h:clinical h:findings<e2> .
2	Thus , <s1>h:ribavirin<e1> may not be useful for treating <s2>h:SARS h:infections<e2> because of its questionable efficacy and because of its known toxicity ( reviewed by van Vonderen et al. , 2003 ; Lai , 2005 ) .
3	In general , <s1>h:steroid therapy<e1> is not recommended in the clinical treatment of <s2>h:SARS-CoV-2<e2> [ 103 ] .
4	In fact , <s1>steroids<e1> are not recommended in <s2>h:COVID-19 h:infection<e2> outside of clinical trial because of potential increased risk of mechanical ventilation ( 10 ) .
5	<s2>Patients with h:PCP<e2> typically die due to refractory hypoxemia from severe respiratory failure , and <s1>h:corticosteroids<e1> have failed to demonstrate benefit outside of the HIV population [ 62 , 63 ] .
6	In addition , <s1>steroids<e1> are not effective for the treatment of <s2>h:lung h:injury or h:shock in h:adults ' h:SARS-CoV-2 h:infection<e2> [ 11 ] .
7	<s1>h:Corticosteroids<e1> in the treatment of <s2>h:SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia<e2> are not usually recommended ; they may delay virus clearance from the body [ 1 , 3 ] .
8	At present , there is no effective therapeutic agent against <s2>h:CVB3<e2> , and only <s1>h:ribavirin<e1> is available for <s2>h:CVB3 h:infection<e2> despite its weak antiviral activity [ 93 ] .
9	<s1>h:Drugs<e1> currently licensed for the treatment of systemic <s2>h:CMV h:infections<e2> have limited therapeutic effectiveness due to dose-limiting toxicities , and prolonged therapy often results in resistance ( Biron , 2006 ) .
10	Most of the <s1>h:TCM h:agents<e1> are mildly effective and slow-acting , and therefore , should not be used as the only treatment modality due to the rapid progression of <s2>h:disease<e2> .
11	In addition , <s1>h:antivirals such as h:NA h:inhibitors and h:M2 h:blockers<e1> have limited efficacy in <s2>h:severe h:cases of h:influenza h:infection<e2> if not administered within 48 hours from symptoms onset and may select for resistance .
12	The efficacy rate is also low in children , and the <s1>h:treatment<e1> is normally ineffective in <s2>h:secondary h:ITP with underlying diseases , such as h:systemic h:lupus h:erythematosus<e2> [ 25 ] .
13	However , <s1>the use of h:corticosteroids<e1> in the treatment of <s2>h:COVID-19<e2> can cause host immune suppression and delay viral clearance .
14	However , <s1>the clinical use of h:interferon<e1> to treat <s2>h:dengue<e2> is not common , possibly due to IFN-Î± side effects associated with its systemic activity .
15	Unfortunately , a consistent benefit has not been observed in all clinical trials and <s1>h:ribavirin<e1> is currently not considered to be a drug of choice for <s2>h:influenza<e2> .
16	For <s2>h:HSV h:encephalitis<e2> , the efficacy of <s1>h:aciclovir h:monotherapy<e1> may be hampered by limited penetration of the drug in the central nervous system .
17	Although , in a substantial cooperative study , <s1>high-dose h:acyclovir<e1> has had certain efficacy for preventing <s2>h:CMV h:disease<e2> ( 101 ) , its utility is limited in a setting where more potent anti-CMV agents ( e.g. , ganciclovir ) are used ( 102 ) .
18	While <s1>h:FAM<e1> is standard therapy for <s2>established h:BOS<e2> , recent data argue strongly against using <s1>h:azithromycin<e1> as <s2>h:prophylaxis against h:BOS<e2> due to decreased survival due to a higher rate of hematologic relapse [ 83 ] .
19	Although a number of <s1>h:antivirals<e1> are available for <s2>h:influenza h:infections<e2> ( e.g. , <s1>h:M2 and h:neuraminidase h:inhibitors<e1> ) , these drugs have only modest efficacy and their use is further limited by resistance that is either preexisting or is rapidly induced during treatment ( 192 ) .
20	Although <s1>h:immunosuppression<e1> is a mainstay of treatment for <s2>h:autoimmunity<e2> , <s1>h:IPEX h:treatment<e1> is frequently limited by insufficient response to therapy or side effects of immune suppression .
21	There has traditionally been no specific treatment for <s2>h:CCHF<e2> , though <s1>h:ribavirin<e1> has demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo activity [ 40 ] .
22	Although <s1>h:biologic h:therapies<e1> provide a valuable treatment option in <s2>h:UC<e2> , they are not clinically effective in all patients and are also associated with secondary loss of response .
23	Currently , there is no vaccine to prevent <s2>h:RSV<e2> , and the only accepted therapy ( <s1>h:ribavirin<e1> ) is seldom used due to its teratogenicity , its limited antiviral effect , and its controversial clinical effectiveness ( 41 , 76 , 85 ) .
24	Treatment with <s1>h:M2 h:inhibitors<e1> , such as <s1>h:amantadine<e1> , is generally not used in <s2>h:transplant h:recipients<e2> because of widespread resistance , the association with prolonged shedding of virus and increased adverse effects [ 6 , 30 ] .
25	Nevertheless , there is currently no definitive benefit proven for <s1>h:antiviral h:treatment<e1> outside of these specific circumstances , as it comes at a cost and may be associated with side effects ; for example , <s1>h:zanamivir<e1> can induce bronchospasms in patients with chronic respiratory disease and asthma .
