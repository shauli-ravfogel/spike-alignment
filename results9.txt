627	Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were shown to share ACE2 as cell surface receptor and TMPRSS2 as the major protease facilitating their entry into the host cell ( Hoffmann et al , 2020 ; Walls et al , 2020 ; Yan et al , 2020 ; Zhou et al , 2020 ) .
628	In addition , as it is known , COVID-19 reaches the cell through angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) receptors and leads to severe pneumonia and thus increased mortality rates during infection by binding to human ACE2 ( 3 , 4 ) .
629	SARS-CoV-2 uses the same cell entry receptor ( ACE2 ) and cellular protease ( TMPRSS2 ) as SARS-CoV for cell entry .
630	The receptor for SARS-CoV is considered to be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) , required for binding to permissive cells and the S1 subunit [ 32 ] .
631	Multiple evidences suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells by binding ACE2 receptor widely expressed in the cardiovascular system .
632	Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) has been shown to be the putative receptor for the virus to enter into host cells [ 15 , 18 ] , and biophysical and structural evidence shows that the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein binds ACE2 with high affinity [ 19 ] .
633	SARS-CoV ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) and other coronaviruses ( 6 , 7 ) also use TMPRSS2 for S protein activation , and the protease is expressed in SARS-CoV target cells throughout the human respiratory tract ( 8) .
634	Most recently , Matsuyama et al. have reported that the current clinical isolates of HCoV-229E preferably use TMPRSS2 , rather than CPL , to infect epithelial cells in the human respiratory tract [ 14 ] , suggesting that HCoV-229E-specific fusion inhibitory peptides are expected to inhibit membrane fusion mediated by HCoV-229E S protein that is proteolytically processed by TMPRSS2 .
635	The ability of SARS-CoV to infect a variety of species is linked to changes in the RBDs that affect ACE2 binding activity [ 48 ] .
636	Transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is much greater than that of SARS-CoV , suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 might use a co-receptor and/or other factors that allow infection of ACE2-expressing cells in the upper respiratory tract ( Lukassen et al. , 2020 ) .
637	ACE2 [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] , an essential regulator of the renin-angiotensin system 39 , is the receptor for both SARS-CoV 40 and SARS-CoV-2 .
638	Similar to SARS-CoV , the SARS-CoV-2 virus may also engage the RBD to bind ACE2 in order to enter human host cells , but since many residues in S1 and S2 have been replaced in SARS-CoV-2 , differences in the interactions with ACE2 on host cells exist [ 33 , 37 ] .
639	In contrast , S1 shows only 70 % identity to other human CoV strains and the differences are concentrated in the RBD , which facilitates virus entry by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) on the cell surface [ 19 ] .
640	Sars-CoV-2 gains entrance in lung cells thanks to the interaction between the S protein and angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) [ 6 , 7 ] .

642	Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) has been confirmed as the receptor of SARS-CoV [ 7 ] , while MERS-CoV has been shown to bind target cells using DPP4 as its receptor [ 8 ] .
643	As a receptor for coronavirus , ACE2 mediates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells in a similar way as for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS-CoV ) .
644	The structure of the receptor-binding gene region is very similar to that of the SARS coronavirus , and the virus has been shown to use the same receptor , the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) , for cell entry [ 9 , 11 ] .

646	SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 , the receptor of the SARS coronavirus .
647	The ACE2 receptor provides a human cell-binding site for the S protein for the SARS-coronavirus ( SARS-CoV ) [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] ( a virus that was first identified in 2003 in a southern province of China [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] ) , the coronavirus NL63 [ 20 , 26 ] , and now SARS-CoV-2 [ 27 ] .
648	The receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 uses host ACE2 for fusion of viral and host cell membranes [ 29 ] .

665	TMPRSS2 activates S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV for viral entry through the plasma membrane [ 11 , 12 ] .
666	Unlike SARS-CoV , which uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) as its receptor for binding to ACE2-expressing cells [ 11 ] , MERS-CoV utilizes a different receptor , dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( DPP4 ) , for binding to DPP4-expressing cells [ 12 ] .

674	Further , it is known that Arginine and lysine residues within amino acids 697 to 716 are essential for efficient ACE2 cleavage by TMPRSS2 ( Heurich et al. , 2014 ) and recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S-protein priming .
675	The SARS CoV has a protein named ORF 3a that shows high pro-apoptotic properties through the cell receptors and mitochondrial pathways [ 34 ] .
676	However , the S protein trimeric structure of the novel coronavirus is more likely to bind to the ACE2 protein on the cell surface , resulting in the novel coronavirus S protein having a 10 to 20 times higher affinity to ACE2 when compared to the SARS virus [ 7 ] .
677	As previously mentioned , SARS-COV-2 virus entry target is the ACE-2 receptor .
678	In vitro studies have shown that coronavirus entry could be mediated by special antibodies that bind the virus surface spike protein and facilitate subsequence viral entry of MERS-CoV [ 56 ] and SARS-CoV [ 57 ] in a receptor-like manner .
679	The receptor-binding domain ( RBD ) in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein has a higher binding affinity for human ACE2 and is significantly higher compared to SARS-CoV-1 [ 34 , 35 ] .

688	The spike ( S ) proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 may use the same host cellular receptor , angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) , for entering into host cells .

788	Zhou et al. indicated that SARS-CoV-2 enters cells through the same receptor for SARS-CoV , which has been identified in ACE2 [ 11 ] .
789	Accumulating evidence based on genomic analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 shares with SARS-CoV the same human cell receptor , the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) , while MERS-CoV uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( DPP4 ) to enter host cells ( Table 1 ) [ 14 ] .
790	ACE2 is necessary for entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells , and studies have shown that the spike ( S ) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is processed by transmembrane serine protease 2 ( TMPRSS2 ) ( Matsuyama et al. 2020 , Hoffmann and Pöhlmann 2020 ) for enhanced viral entry .
791	If SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for cell entry , the transmembrane protease , serine 2 ( TMPRSS2 ) for S protein is priming such internalization resulting in an enhanced isolation of SARS-CoV-2 in cells expressing this type II transmembrane serine protease [ 20 ] .

814	The Gn glycoproteins of pathogenic New World hantaviruses and SEOV possess an immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif ( ITAM ) in the cytoplasmic tail that binds to Fyn tyrosine kinase , and the ITAM may also interact with Lyn , Syk , and ZAP-70 kinases found in lymphocytes [ 58 , 59 ] , although there is no evidence that lymphocytes are susceptible to hantaviruses .

830	SARS-CoV-like viruses usually have six critical amino acids in the receptor binding domain ( RBD ) of the spike ( S ) protein for binding to receptor ACE2 and for determining the host range , and 5 of the 6 amino acids in SARS-CoV-2 differed from SARS-CoV [ 15 ] .
831	As the ACE2 receptor is the mechanism of entry for SARS-CoV2 , some data suggest that ACE inhibitors ( ACEi ) and angiotensin receptor blockers ( ARB ) may upregulate ACE2 , thereby increasing susceptibility to the virus ( Figure 1 ) ( 5 ) .

864	Previous research has shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) is the functional receptor of SARS-CoV and is critical to the cellular entry of SARS-CoV ( 4 ) .
865	SAR-CoV-2 may directly interact with the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System , with the virus using the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) as its host receptor on type II pneumocytes .
866	Similar to other coronaviruses , SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) protein to gain entry into cells 6 , 7 .
867	Although the RaTG13 coronavirus isolated from bat has about 96 % identity with SARS-CoV-2 , its RBD is different from that of the later , exhibiting a low binding ability to the human ACE2 [ 37 ] .
868	Like the spike ( S ) protein of SARS-CoV , the S protein of MERS-CoV also plays important roles in virus entry and infection [ 13 ] .
869	In contrast to other coronaviruses , SARS-CoV could prevent IFN-β production upon infection and can suppress IFN immune signaling through directly acting on host proteins via P6 ( Spiegel et al. , 2005 ) .
870	As SARS-CoV-1 , the S ( through the S1 ) protein mediates viral attachment to specific cell receptor ACE2 [ 1 ] and fusion between the envelope and plasma membrane .
871	It has been speculated that SARS-CoV-2 , which has a close similarity to SARS-CoV , using human angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 as the binding receptor to invade host cells and then replicates in the host cells .
872	Recent studies have revealed that ACE2 interacts with transmembrane protease , serine 2 ( TMPRSS2 ) , which is responsible for the S protein activation of SARS-CoV-2 , just as in SARS coronavirus [ 3 , 10 , 12 ] .
873	The PLP of SARS-CoV and the analogous PLP-2 of MHV have deubiquitinating activity in addition to protease activity , and it has been suggested that this activity could confer type I IFN antagonism ( Barretto et al. , 2005 ; Zheng et al. , 2008 ) .
874	To infect cells , the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) on host airway cells .
875	Remarkably , the RBD of MERS-CoV , which is structurally similar to that of COVID-19 ( 20.1 % sequence identity , 65 % structure similarity ) recognizes a different host receptor ( DPP4 ) for its cell entry and does not bind ACE2 ( 14 ) .
876	Another PC necessary for viral entry is the transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 , which is known to contribute to efficient SARS-CoV cell entry and Hoffman et al. , has produced in vitro data showing that SARS-CoV-2 also uses TMPRSS2 priming [ 24 ] .
877	In vitro studies suggest that MERS-CoV has tropism for kidney epithelial cells [ 187 ] .
878	Similarly , SARS-CoV-2 mainly infects type II alveolar epithelial cells , which express high levels of ACE2 [ 30 ] .
879	Commonly used laboratory animal species such as Syrian hamsters , mice and ferrets are not susceptible to MERS-CoV , due to differences in the MERS-CoV receptor dipeptyl peptidase 4 ( DPP4 ) .
880	Accumulating evidence has shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) , a metallopeptidase , is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV that can bind to the S1 domain of the S protein of SARS-CoV [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] .
881	Influenza A virus interacts with STING through its conserved hemagglutinin fusion peptide ( FP ) to inhibits STING activation in response to membrane fusion [ 58 ] .
882	Research has found that SARS-CoV-2 can use TMPRSS2 rather than CatB/L for S protein priming , and the spread of SARS-CoV-2 might also be intimately associated with TMPRSS2 activity .
883	Unlike SARS-CoV , MERS-CoV requires DPP4 ( also known as CD26 ) as its cellular receptor [ 60 , 61 ] but not ACE2 .
884	Similarly to SARS-coronavirus , SARS-CoV-2 seems able to enter in the respiratory epithelium ( RE ) by binding the human ACE2 receptor .
885	Both the novel coronavirus and SARS-2003 could enter the host cell by binding the S protein on the viral surface to the ACE2 on the cell surface [ 3 , 5 ] .
886	Although it has been confirmed that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 as receptor and occupy the same binding site , their binding affinities to ACE2 vary due to subtle interface sequence variations [ 9 ] .
887	SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a cell receptor , TMPRSS2 protease , and FURIN peptidase to invade human cells .

892	The main host receptor of the SARS-CoV-2 is angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) , a major component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( RAAS ) .
893	Although immune cells lack ACE2 , SARS-CoV can infect human macrophages and dedritic cells Tseng et al. , 2005 ; Yilla et al. , 2005 ) without producing infectious virus particles , suggesting that SARS-CoV can entry the immune cells via other receptors .
894	Furthermore , SARS-CoV 2 can use TMPRSS2 for S protein priming and camostat mesylate , an inhibitor of TMPRSS2 , blocked SARS-CoV 2 infection of lung cells ( 63 ) .
895	The cellular entry receptor for the SARS-CoV is Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) .

899	The ORF 4b encoded accessory proteins of MERS-CoV and two related bat CoVs localize to the cell nucleus and inhibit type I IFN production and NF-κB signaling pathway ( Matthews et al. , 2014 ) .
900	In addition , SARS-CoV and human CoV 229E macrodomain-mutant viruses had increased sensitivity to IFN-I treatment in cell culture , demonstrating that the CoV macrodomain counters antiviral activities of ISGs [ 48 ] .
901	Recent studies have indicated that SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated 10 - 20 times greater affinity to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) receptors compared to SARS-CoV-1 , making it a much more virulent virus ( 9 , 10 ) .
902	It has been supposed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus , similar to SARS CoV , exploits the same receptors , namely the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) for entering host cells [ 4 , 5 ] .
903	The coronavirus S protein mediates infection of permissive cells through interaction of its S1 domain with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) , which is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV 106 .

905	SARS-CoV-2 uses the receptor ACE2 for cell entry , and podocytes express ACE2 .
906	By binding to the ACE-2 expressed on the respiratory epithelial cells , the SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 not only mediates infection but also facilitates their replication and transmission [ 2 , 12 , 15 , 16 ] .
907	The MERS-CoV N protein has a similar function as SARS-CoV N to inhibit RIG-I activation ( 25 ) .
908	Indeed , the SARS-CoV-2 S protein has 380 amino acid sequence substitutions compared to other SARS-like viruses [ 27 ] .
909	It has been reported that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) is the main host cell receptor of the novel 2019 coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 , and plays a crucial role in the docking and entry of the virus into the cell .
910	It has been reported that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) is the main host cell receptor of the novel 2019 coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 , and plays a crucial role in the docking and entry of the virus into the cell .

912	To fulfill its function , SARS-CoV-2 spike binds to its receptor human ACE2 ( hACE2 ) through its receptor-binding domain ( RBD ) and is proteolytically activated by human proteases .
913	Like other coronaviruses such as the SARS-CoV , the 2019-nCoV uses the receptor binding domain ( RBD ) of the surface spike glycoprotein ( S protein ) to engage ACE2 .
914	To enter airway and lung epithelia , SARS-CoV-2 attaches to ACE2 receptors by spike ( S ) glycoproteins .
915	The spike protein on the viral surface of SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to bind to ACE2 with 10 - 20 times the affinity of SARS-CoV-1 , the coronavirus responsible for the SARS outbreak in 2003 [ 19 , 20 ] .
916	SARS-CoV-2 possesses more powerful pathogenicity and transmissibility than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV , because SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 have a stronger binding capacity ( Zou et al. 2020 ) .
917	Molecular studies suggest that the coronavirus uses the plasma membrane ectoenzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor ( ACE2 ) for cell entry , with binding of the viral spike ( S ) glycoprotein to cellular receptors via S protein priming by host cell proteases [ 12 ] .
918	Biophysical and structural evidence that new SARS-CoV-2 may bind ACE2 receptor with higher affinity than SARS-CoV has been recently reported [ 9 ] .
919	The biology of SARS-CoV-2 is of interest as it uses densely glycosylated spike ( S ) protein to enter host cells and bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor ( expressed in type II alveolar cells ) , similar to the 2003 coronavirus that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS-CoV ) .
920	A prior study suggested that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bind to the same ACE2 receptor [ 9 ] .
921	SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to exhibit novel glycosylation sites in the spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV , suggesting that the virus may utilize different glycosylation sites to interact with its receptors ( Kumar et al. 2020 ) .
922	Recent studies have identified bat as the possible origin of SARS-CoV-2 , and the virus likely uses the same cell surface receptor as SARS-CoV [ 4 ] , namely ACE2 .
923	However , the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S1/S2 subunits , which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from SARS-CoV and SARS-related CoVs [ 15 , 16 ] .
924	ACE-2 serves as the cellular entry point for coronaviruses , including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 ( 10 ) .
925	Analysis of the structures of the spike protein and its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) indicated that aa 487 of spike is important for spike-ACE2 interaction and a mutation from Ser487 ( civet ) to Thr487 appeared to enhance human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV ( Li et al. , 2005c ) .
926	Just recently , it has been demonstrated that the TMPRSS2-expressing kidney epithelial cell line ( VeroE6 ) was highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection [ 19 ] , which suggests that TMPRSS2 protease is a key protease for entry of the virus into cells .
927	In supporting the process of entry of the virus into the host cell , SARS-CoV2 binds to the ACE2 receiver that is highly expressed in the lower respiratory tract such as type II alveolar cells ( AT2 ) of the lungs , upper esophagus and stratified epithelial cells , and other cells such as absorptive enterocytes from the ileum and colon , cholangiocytes , myocardial cells , kidney proximal tubule cells , and bladder urothelial cells [ 14 ] .
928	Another route of entry of SARS-CoV-2 to human host is through its interactions with CD147 [ 14 ] , which is present in tear and human ocular tissues , e.g. , corneal epithelium , endothelium , keratocytes , conjunctiva , and retinal pigment epithelium [ 15 ] .
929	The Spike protein on SARS-CoV-2 has a 10 to 20 fold higher 52 affinity for the ACE2 protein than its SARS-CoV homologue [ 3 , 6 ] .
930	It has been computationally determined that the SARS-CoV-2 has similar mechanism to that of the SARS virus and the receptor to which it has the highest affinity is ACE2 ( angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ) [ 4 ] .
931	The receptor binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV is a promising antigen candidate since it binds to the human host-cell receptor , angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( Li et al. , 2003 ; Wong et al. , 2004 ; Graham et al. , 2013 ; Lu et al. , 2013 ; Zhang et al. , 2014 ) .
932	In a short time following the outbreak , it has been shown that , similar to SARS-CoV , COVID-19 virus exploits the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) receptor to gain entry inside the cells .
933	SARS-CoV-2 infection is reminiscent of the SARS-CoV outbreak in early 2003 , because both viruses attack cells via the same ACE2 receptor ( 3 ) .
934	Moreover , the more closely related human alphacoronavirus , HCoV-NL63 , uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 as receptor ( Hofmann et al. , 2005 ) .
935	Similarly , hepatitis C virus utilizes CD81 as a receptor and LDLR as a coreceptor [ 20 ] .
936	SARS-CoV-2 as a subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus showed similar receptor-binding domain structure with SARS-CoV , and it may use ACE2 as a receptor ( Lu et al. , 2020 ) .
937	Studies indicate that ACE2 is now likely to be the host receptor for the coronavirus 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 ( COVID-19 ) [ 4 , 5 ] .
938	ACE2 has been identified as the main receptor utilized by SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 to enter cells 7 .
939	However , Wrapp et al. found that SARS-CoV-2 S binding to ACE2 has approximately 10-to 20-fold higher affinity than SARS-CoV S , which can provide one explanation why SARS-CoV-2 has more human-to human spread compared to SARS-CoV [ 97 ] .
940	Mechanistically , SARS-CoV-2 virus has developed an ability to enter host cells through interacting directly with angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ( ACE-2 ) , which is widely expressed in various tissues including brain ( Gheblawi et al. , 2020 ) .
941	Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is the functional receptor for the SARS-CoV and mediates SARS-CoV pulmonary infection [ 8 , 10 ] .
942	Like HCoV-NL63 , SARS-CoV uses a recessed , although broader ACE2-binding surface , which can accommodate mutations that permit crossspecies receptor recognition [ 13 ] .
