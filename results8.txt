980	During infection , hRSV is phagocyted by DCs and impair its maturation ( 4 ) .
981	MERS-CoV uses a cell surface amino peptidase , dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( DPP4 ) , also known as CD26 , as a functional receptor4 .
982	SARS-CoV and several SARS-related coronaviruses ( SARSr-CoV ) interact directly with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) via S B to enter target cells ( Ge et al. , 2013 ; Kirchdoerfer et al. , 2018 ; Li et al. , 2005a ; Li et al. , 2003 ; Song et al. , 2018 ; Yang et al. , 2015a ) .
983	SARS-CoV-1 ( and likely the homologous SARS-CoV-2 ) express proteins that inhibit type I IFN production ( e.g. through inhibition of TLR3 and TLR7 signaling pathways ) , which delays the antiviral response and facilitates rapid viral replication and extensive virus-induced direct cytopathic effects in early stages of disease [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] .
984	Recombinant SARS-CoVs with either deletion of ORF3a or defective ion channel activity of E protein are compromised in the activation of IL-1β maturation and secretion [ 73 , 74 ] .
985	Both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV bind to a large ectopeptidase ( DPP4 and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 , respectively ) to enter cells .
986	32 The dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 ( DPP4/CD26 ) was identified as the host-cell receptor for the entry of MERS-CoV. 13 , 36 Both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV bind to large ectopeptidases ( DPP4 and ACE2 , respectively ) to invade the cells .
987	Apart from the respiratory system , it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 can also directly infect other tissues such as the kidney or induce acute renal failure .
988	The spike protein of SARS-CoV-1 attaches to ACE2 and downregulates ACE2 and activates Angiotensin II to exacerbate acute lung injury .
989	After primary infection , SARS-CoV grows at a fast rate and spreads to different organs , including the lungs [ 161 , 164 , 167 ] .
990	Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV , SARS-CoV-2 can lead to lethal pneumonia , but it also has a stronger human-to-human transmission capacity than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [ 4 , 5 ] .
991	Recently , it has been shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) coronavirus , the cause of SARS , utilizes ACE2 as an essential receptor for cell fusion and in vivo infections in mice .
992	SARS-CoV-2 similarly to SARS-CoV requires angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( AcE2 ) for entry into target cells ( 48 ) .
993	During infection , PRRSV replicates in the CD163 + cells in the lungs and induces apoptosis at the early stages of infection [ 33 ] .
994	The spike protein of these coronaviruses binds ACE-2 , which is highly expressed in the lungs , endothelium , and heart , leading to not just respiratory but also potential CV damage ( 2 ) .
995	SARS-CoV-2 enters cells using two host cellular proteins : angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ( ACE2 ) and transmembrane serine protease 2 ( TMPRSS2 ) .
996	The pathogenesis of Hantavirus is related to the targeting of vascular endothelial cells , alveolar macrophages and follicular dendritic cells , as well as the renal tubular epithelium [ 27 ] .
997	Upon binding , SARS-CoV-2 may downregulate ACE2 expression , leading to enhanced pro-fibrotic angiotensin II activity and acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) [ 40 , 41 ] .
998	In humans , sArs-CoV replication destroys respiratory epithelium , and a great deal of the pathogenesis is due to the subsequent immune responses ( Chen and subbarao , 2007 ; Perlman and Dandekar , 2005 ) .
999	Studies have shown that ACE2 is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells , and ACE2 is present in large quantities in human lung and small intestinal epithelial cells , which is essential for the spread of the epidemic .
